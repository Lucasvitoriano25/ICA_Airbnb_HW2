# Airbnb Price Prediction and Analysis

## Project Overview

In the context of big data, Airbnb stands out as a company frequently used for study and analysis due to the high availability of data it provides. This makes it a significant player in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing. Using the Python programming language and the "New York City Airbnb Open Data" dataset", we have conducted price predictions for rentals using linear regression techniques. Additionally, we have performed operations to identify patterns and behaviors in the dataset columns, utilizing various types of graphs, including scatter and biplot. These analyses enable us to answer questions such as which regions in New York are more likely to adopt this technology and which locations have the highest rental prices.

## Data Preprocessing

To work with the available data, we needed to convert categorical data into numerical data in three columns of the dataset [1]: "neighbourhood group," "neighbourhood," and "room type." For this purpose, we utilized Python libraries.

## Predictive Models

Regarding the predictive models used to create rental type predictions, several were employed, including:

- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

We compared these models to identify which prediction method best suits our context. For evaluation, we used accuracy, precision, and recall as performance metrics.
